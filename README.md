# Hinglish-AI-Calling-Bot
This project is an open-source telephony automation tool designed to bridge the gap between lead generation and qualification.[1] Using Python (Flask) and the Twilio API, the bot automates the outreach process by calling leads from a Google Sheet, interacting with them using a natural Hindi AI voice, and intelligently logging their responses.
